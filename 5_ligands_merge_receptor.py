### Read coordinates from the receptor

#with os.scandir(path_to_receptor) as rp:        # rp is a list of all receptor PDBs

            continue

                                        # order of dimensions: xyz, atom [:,:]

### Read the data from each ligand file

### LOGIC BLOCK

# We want to subtract the coords of each atom of the ligand from each atom of the receptor
# If the amount of difference (abs()) is lower than 0.3 at ANY of these positions, we DONT want to write it down
# If it is ALWAYS larger, we want to write both ligand and receptor to a new file.

    Otherwise, if the ligand is sufficiently far away, returns True'''

### Iteration and Writing of the new files, if the receptor and ligand are far enough apart

# For each ligand, check if it is far enough apart from the receptor,
# If yes , combine both coords into one file.
# Write ligand first
# Put a TER statement
# Write receptor
# Put a TER
# Put END
